And, it would be better there is an option for two sim cards along with a micro sd card space option. Got the free charger. The phone heats up while charging but that's not a big deal for me as I always do it while switching it off. Bought the whole set in exchange of my realme narzo 10a for which I have got the full exchange value. Overall I am satisfied with my new phone. Amazon helped me by delivering all the things and making the exchange in a single day. The behaviour and service of the delivery agent was nice. So, thanks a lot to Amazon");
